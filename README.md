NBodies assignment 1 - Connor Barski
Firstly, I ran out of time on this version and did not finish. This Assignment was going fine until I started implementing the lists. The lists were simple, creating an instance and using that for both linked and array lists, which let me simplify them. The list starts with the add and get functions in the instance. Then the linked list  starts by making a new node to store the head value. The add function checks first if the list is empty, it then creates a previous node and increments to the last node sets the next to the new data. The get function iterates to the index and returns the data. The array list starts by initializing a list of 10 data points and the size to 0. For add it checks if the array is full, if it is, it creates a new array twice the data than the first. It adds the old data to the new array, then adds the new data at the next index and returns true. The get function checks for index out of bounds, and returns the data at the index. I struggled a lot with implementing the lists into the main program, and that is where I ran out of time.
